version 1.2.0:(2012-03-30)

- GRanges is default class for peaksets and reports instead of RangedData, controlled by DataType parameter.

  Section added to vignette showing an ananalysis using a blocking factor.

- Added new metadata type, DBA_TREATMENT.

  method on the fly in dba.plotHeatmap and dba.plotPCA when plotting global binding matrix.
