version 1.2.0:(2012-03-30)

- GRanges is default class for peaksets and reports instead of RangedData, controlled by DataType parameter.

- Both analysis methods (edgeR and DESeq) use generalized linear models (GLMs) for two-group contrasts by default.

- Blocking factors (for two-factor analysis) can be specified flexibly such that arbitrary blocking factors can be used. 
  Section added to vignette showing an ananalysis using a blocking factor.

- Added new metadata type, DBA_TREATMENT.

- New DBA_SCORE_ options for specifying scoring method, including TMM normalized counts, and ability to change scoring 
  method on the fly in dba.plotHeatmap and dba.plotPCA when plotting global binding matrix.

- bRemoveDuplicates parameter in dba.count allows duplicate reads to be discarded when computing counts

- More efficient use of memory when analyzing (controlled by bReduceObjects parameter in dba.analyze).

- various bugs fixed, man pages updated, and warning messages added.
