version 1.3.10:(2012-09-18)

- minor changes to vignette

version 1.3.9:(2012-09-18)

- minor changes to sample sheets/config sheets
- add SN (Signal to Noise) to dba.count and dba.show; added DBA_INTERVALS and DBASN_RATIO constant variables
- updated vignette

version 1.3.8:(2012-09-17)

- update vignette

version 1.3.7:(2012-09-14)

- add option to dba.count to pass a mask as a value to peak parameter to be applied before deriving consensus set

- purge references to SAM files in documentation

version 1.3.6:(2012-09-12)

- added bScaleControl parameter to dba.count to enable Control read counts to be scaled down if there are more reads in the Control library than the matching ChIP library.

version 1.3.5:(2012-09-11)

- restored smoothScatter option to dba.plotMA -- made default.

- bugfixes 

version 1.3.4:(2012-09-07)

- changed Venn plotting to overLapper (Thomas Girke); added 4-way Venns

- added 4-way overlaps to dba.overlaps

- added ability to genreate sets of concensus peaksets based on metadata attibutes: for example create consensus peaksets for each tissue typend/or condition, or for all unique samples by taking the consnesus of their replicate peaksets.

- added more flexibility in specifying peak file formats in dba.peakset and dba

- can specify mask along with contrast in dba.plotHeatmap and dba.plotPCA to select samples to plot using DB sites

version 1.3.3:(2012-09-02)

- side colorbars added to dba.plotHeatmap

- fold added to dba.plotMA

- fixes for edgeR changes

version 1.2.3:(2012-09-01)

- more informative warnings and minor bug fixes.

version 1.2.0:(2012-03-30)

- GRanges is default class for peaksets and reports instead of RangedData, controlled by DataType parameter.

- Both analysis methods (edgeR and DESeq) use generalized linear models (GLMs) for two-group contrasts by default.

- Blocking factors (for two-factor analysis) can be specified flexibly such that arbitrary blocking factors can be used. 
  Section added to vignette showing an ananalysis using a blocking factor.

- Added new metadata type, DBA_TREATMENT.

- New DBA_SCORE_ options for specifying scoring method, including TMM normalized counts, and ability to change scoring 
  method on the fly in dba.plotHeatmap and dba.plotPCA when plotting global binding matrix.

- bRemoveDuplicates parameter in dba.count allows duplicate reads to be discarded when computing counts

- More efficient use of memory when analyzing (controlled by bReduceObjects parameter in dba.analyze).

- various bugs fixed, man pages updated, and warning messages added.
